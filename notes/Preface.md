What is Data Science? 

- Interdisplinary discipline 
- Comprises of tools and techniques that enables us to learn from, manipulate, process, extract, visualize, model data 
- Three areas 
Statistics - to model and understand data. Statistics basically help us understand data,gives us tools to define it, gives us tools to describe it and model it to answer questions 
Computer Science - algorithms that can store, process and visualize the data and also use it to build things 
Domain expertise - This is going to help us better map the questions and answers to the data that  we have 


- It is a set of skills that enables us to ask and answer questions 

-How to learn Python as a tool to process computationally intensive tasks and handle large datasets? 
- Why is python highly used for data science? 
Because it has a well supported and established stack - a set of libraries that helps us manipulate, handle, store and visualize data 
Namely: Numpy - for manipulation of homogenous array- based data 
Pandas - heterogenous and labeled data - tabular like 
SciPy - for common scientific tasks 
Matplotlib - for publication quality visualizations 
IPython - interactive execution and sharing of code
Jupyter - documentation 
Scikit-Learn - machine learning and more tools 
there are other packages that are becoming popular as we speak, referenced in this book 



What is homogenous and heterogenous data ? 
-- homogenous data -> all data points are of the same type. eg: an array of numbers
-- heterogenous data -> data structure that houses data of different types in a data point 

Installation 
- Installing Python 
pretty striaghtforward: can download from website, can download via command prompt,but apparently using Anaconda distribution is best becaues it comes in two flavours

- Miniconda : Python interpreter + commandline tool conda (cross platform package manager for python packages)
a package manager basically handles installing, versioning and configuration of packages 
What is a python interpreter? 
- software that compiles python line by line as opposed to other interpreters
- reads python from script or interactive shell (shell is what helps you interact with the os)
- translates it into bytecode (an intermediate representation)
- executes the byecode on the python virtual machine
What is the advantage of having an interpreter? 
 if an error is encountered, execution is stopped and makes debugging easier
 since it runs on an interpreter, it is cross platform 
 and can run without recompilation 
 - can test code without compiling the whole script 
 - that is why it is useful for data science, since most of it is experimentation 
- Python REPL - read eval print loop allows running code interactively 
- easy to test small snippets of code before putting them into a script 
- does not generate large binary files 
Downsides
slower when you try to run whole scripts or modules cause it has to compile line by line 

- Anaconda -  includes both python and conda and some other packages

-conda install package_name for isntallation 
- conda-forge for a open source community driven packages
